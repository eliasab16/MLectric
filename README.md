Object detection and image classification model pipeline for reading schematics and identifying electrical components.

The training entailed tens of model iterations, model evaluations, and data experimentation. I spent several weeks working (and learning) on building this pipeline until I achieved the desired performance.

Final model deployment is a work-in-progress.
